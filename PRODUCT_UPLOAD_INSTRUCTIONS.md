## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Upload Utility

1. Navigate to your Fordips Tech website folder
2. Open `upload-latest-products.html` in your web browser
3. You can also access it by visiting: `https://your-domain.com/upload-latest-products.html`

### Step 2: Verify You're Logged In

- The utility uses your existing admin session
- If you're not logged in, you'll see an error
- Login to admin panel first if needed: `https://your-domain.com/admin.html`

### Step 3: Review Product Statistics

The dashboard shows:
- **Total Products**: 87 products ready to upload

### Step 5: Monitor the Upload Process

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Product Information
- **All products have detailed descriptions** (50-150 words each)
- **Professional product images** from Unsplash
- **Proper categorization** using Supabase category slugs
- **Stock quantities** are pre-set (can be adjusted in admin panel)
- **Badges** (NEW, HOT, POPULAR, VALUE, PRO) are assigned appropriately

### Duplicate Prevention
- If a product already exists, the upload may fail
- This is normal behavior to prevent duplicates
- Check the error message to identify duplicates

### Database Schema
Products are uploaded with these fields:
```javascript
{
    name: string,              // Product name
    category_slug: string,     // Category (iphone, samsung, laptop, tablet, smartwatch)
    price: number,             // Price in USD
    description: string,       // Detailed product description
    image_url: string,         // Product image URL
    badge: string | null,      // Badge text (NEW, HOT, etc.)
    stock_quantity: number,    // Available stock
    is_active: boolean         // Product visibility
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Not authenticated" error
**Solution**: Log in to the admin panel first at `/admin.html`

### Problem: "Product already exists"
**Solution**: This is normal. The product is already in the database. You can:
1. Skip it (it's already there)
2. Delete it from admin panel first
3. Update it manually in admin panel

### Problem: Upload button is disabled
**Solution**:
1. Wait for current upload to complete
2. Refresh the page if stuck
3. Check browser console for errors

### Problem: All uploads failing
**Solution**:
1. Verify Supabase connection in `config.js`
2. Check admin permissions
3. Verify internet connection
4. Check Supabase console for database issues
