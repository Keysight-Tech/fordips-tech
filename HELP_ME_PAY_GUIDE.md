# Help Me Pay System - User Guide

## Overview
The Help Me Pay feature allows customers to request payment assistance from friends or family. When enabled, the system sends a secure payment link to the designated helper, who can then complete the payment on behalf of the customer.

## How It Works

### For Customers (Requesters)

1. **Add items to cart** - Browse products and add desired items to shopping cart
2. **Open checkout** - Click the cart icon and proceed to checkout

4. **Fill in helper details**:
   - Helper's name (required)
   - Helper's email OR phone number (at least one required)
   - Optional personal message
5. **Review order summary** - Verify items, quantities, and total
6. **Send request** - Submit the payment request
7. **Confirmation** - Receive order ID and pending status

### For Helpers (Payers)

1. **Receive notification** - Get email/SMS with payment link
2. **Click payment link** - Opens secure payment page
3. **Review order details**:
   - See who sent the request
   - View all items and total amount
   - Read personal message (if provided)
4. **Choose payment method**:
   - Credit/Debit Card
   - PayPal
   - Stripe
   - MTN Mobile Money
   - Other supported methods
5. **Complete payment** - Enter payment details and submit
6. **Confirmation** - Both parties receive confirmation

    expiresAt: ISO8601,
    paidAt?: ISO8601,
    payerName?: string,
